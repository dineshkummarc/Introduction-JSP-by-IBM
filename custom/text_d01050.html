Let’s talk for a moment about what JSPs contain. We know that JSPs are a new type of file that combines standard HTML and new tags for scripting in the Java language. <br>

JSPs look like HTML, but they are code that gets compiled into Java servlets.  The responsibility of the resulting servlet is to generate a user page.

The dynamic content will be specific to a given http request.<br>
