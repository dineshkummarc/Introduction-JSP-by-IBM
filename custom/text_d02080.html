Use of servlets increases portability. Servlet technology replaces the family of server plug-ins such as NSAPI or GWAPI, which are not standardized like the JavaServer API.<br>
<br>
Since servlets are written in the Java language, they have the write-once, run-anywhere capability and can easily exploit platform independence. They are able to exploit re-useable Java components called JavaBeans.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if the WebSphere servlet engine plug-in is used, it provides a consistent servlet environment across different web servers such as Apache, IBM HTTP Server, Domino Server, Lotus Domino Go, Netscape, and IIS.<br>
