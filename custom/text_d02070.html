Java Servlets provide better performance than CGI-based applications.  CGI-based applications require process creation overhead for each user request.<br>
<br>
Servlets run in the same context as the application server and can be preloaded or loaded on demand. Since they execute and remain in memory, they incur load overhead only once. <br>
<br>
Additionally, servlets maintain sessions across http requests reducing activity to backend systems. They’re multi-threaded to scale with multiprocessors and heterogeneous systems.<br>
