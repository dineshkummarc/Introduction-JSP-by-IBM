We said that servlets and back-end applications, such as databases, supply dynamic content in a result bean. <br>
<br>
The JSP accesses the result bean object via a tag. The tag specifies how to find or create a bean. <br>
<br>
* If an existing bean is to be accessed, it is either retrieved from the session or the request context.<br>
* If a bean needs to be created, it is instantiated from a serialized bean, or a new bean is constructed.  <br>
