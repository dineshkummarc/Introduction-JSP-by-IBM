The most important thing to know about this lecture is that it uses streaming audio. We have used Bamba, an extremely compressed media format, to give the best possible web performance. You will also need a Java-enabled browser, such as Netscape 4. <br>
<br>
To hear audio, just give the Bamba player time to download fully. The download is automatic... you don’t have to do anything. When the download is finished, you’ll hear audio for the discussion item you’re on. Once the Bamba player has downloaded, you can use the player controls to stop the audio, then resume it at the beginning or anywhere in the audio file. Try those controls now if your audio is playing.<br>
<br>
If your audio is not working properly or if you prefer to read, we’ve provided all the lecture text in a scrolling box on the right of the screen. It’s your choice. Get the information any way it suits you best.<br>
