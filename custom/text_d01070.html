There are two ways to invoke a JSP.<br>
<br>
In Model 1, a user working in a browser makes a request that is sent to a JSP file. After receiving the client request, the servlet that is compiled from the JSP file requests information from a JavaBean. The JavaBean can, in turn, request information from an Enterprise JavaBean, database, or other back-end service. Once the JavaBean accesses the requested content, the JSP servlet can query and display the information as HTML in the user response. <br>
