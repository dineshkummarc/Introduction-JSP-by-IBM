In the previous Overview topic, we discussed where servlets fit in the JSP picture. Let’s review that now.<br>
<br>
You recall that JSPs are text pages that have all the information needed to generate servlets. <br>
<br>
Servlets are compiled applications that will respond to the user’s request with an HTML reply.<br>
<br>
Typically, most of the JSP file looks like HTML to be returned to the user.  New tags specify the Java code to produce dynamic content.  A servlet compiled from a JSP file generates an HTML response like that of the JSP with appropriate, dynamic HTML according to the Java code specified by the new JSP tags.<br>
