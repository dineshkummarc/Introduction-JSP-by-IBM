Let’s talk about how JSPs simplify the task of writing dynamic web pages. <br>
<br>
<b>First</b>, Java is known for its characteristic of  "write once, run anywhere."<br>
JSPs are entirely platform independent, both in dynamic Web pages and underlying server components. You can write the dynamic web pages on any platform, run them on any Web server, and access them from any Web browser. <br>
<br>
<b>Second</b>, JSPs encourage the use of reusable, cross-platform server components called JavaBeans. This saves development time, while giving you the power and flexibility of the Java programming language. And because components do much of the processing work, component development is more cleanly separated from Web design, improving the productivity of cross-functional teams. <br>
     <br>
<b>Third</b>, JSPs are an integral part of the Java Platform for the Enterprise, which brings Java technology to enterprise computing.  You can now develop powerful enterprise-wide or middle-tier server applications, using a JSP web site as a front end. When you want to update your application, you can update the components and dynamic web pages that reside on the server, updating all your users at once. <br>
