The navigation for the lecture is easy. <br>
<br>
Use FORWARD and BACK to look one slide ahead or back. <br>
<br>
INDEX gives you a listing of all the items in the topic so you can quickly jump to one item of interest. <br>
<br>
MORE is used occasionally to give an additional or supporting example, demonstration, or sample. <br>
<br>
Use FEEDBACK to send an email to the hosting site with your comments. <br>
<br>
Finally, when you click EXIT, you’ll go back to the menu for this lecture. And from there, you can go back to the Java Education homepage.<br>
<br>
Try that navigation now, if you like. <br>
<br>
Okay. We’re ready to look at a topic. Click EXIT to go to the lecture menu so we can get started.<br>
