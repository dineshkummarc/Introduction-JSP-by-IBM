One use of JavaBeans is as a data encapsulator.  A property of a JavaBean is simply the data (state) of the bean. Properties are accessible by two methods: the getter and the setter.  The value of the property is accessed by the getter method.  If the property is writeable, its value is changed by the setter method.<br>
 <br>
Look at the example on your screen. The method pair defines a bean property named "time" whose access type is a Date (java.util.Date)<br>

The properties and methods of a JavaBean are an API for exchanging data and providing services. Access to a bean only requires sending messages to the bean instance.  Most enterprise tools, such as VisualAge/Java, generate Java classes that conform to JavaBean specifications.<br>
