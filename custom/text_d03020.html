A JavaBean is a reusable software component.  JavaBeans are Java objects that use a standard "method" naming conventions. This gives them predictable behavior and makes tool-based manipulation easy. <br>
<br>
The public features of JavaBeans are properties, methods, and events.<br>
<br>
Properties are the parts of a JavaBean.  They might be other Java objects, primitives. As we will see in the next slide, properties of JavaBeans are defined by pairs of public "getter" and "setter" methods.<br>
<br>
A method is an action or service that the JavaBean can perform.<br>
<br>
An event is a notification by the JavaBean that something of interest has happened.<br>
<br>
In the next slides, we’ll give more details on bean functionality.<br>
