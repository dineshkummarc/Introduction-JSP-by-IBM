If you looked at the bean tag shown on the MORE page last screen, you saw some bean tag attributes, such as name, varname, type, introspect, beanName, create, and scope.<br>
 <br>
Let’s talk about what those attributes mean.<br>
<br>
Name is the value of the key used to look up the bean, for example, key-value for getValue() or getAttribute().<br>
<br>
Varname is the name of the local variable that refers to the bean and is available for use by scriptlets.  If the varname attribute isn’t specified, the value of the name attribute will be used.<br>
<br>
Type is the Java type of the JavaBean being accessed. The default type is java.lang.Object.<br>
<br>
When introspect is yes, each property of the bean whose name matches the name of a request parameter will have its setter method called to set the property value to the value of the corresponding request parameter. The default value for introspect is yes.<br>
