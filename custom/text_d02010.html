In this topic, we’ll discuss JSP servlets. <br>
<br>
Servlets are standard, server-side Java applications that extend the capabilities of a web server. <br>
<br>
Servlets are Java code that runs in the context of an existing Java environment, the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short. Servlets are loaded into an application server, such as a WebSphere Application Server.<br>
<br>
Since a servlet is invoked by a user request, it represents the system’s response for a single location in a web site.  An enterprise web site may have several servlets for individual requirements such as registration, shopping, and purchasing.<br>
<br>
Since servlets run inside servers, users never actually see them, so they do not need a graphical user interface. They are Java components that are  loaded, on demand, as the system needs them.<br>
