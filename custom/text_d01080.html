Model 2 shows another way to use JSPs, by sending a request to a Java servlet. <br>
<br>
In this example, the client makes a request that is handled by a Java servlet. The servlet, like the JSP in the Model 1 case, will request dynamic content from a JavaBean or Enterprise JavaBean. <br>
<br>
The resulting dynamic content is then wrapped in a JavaBean. The servlet invokes the JSPs servlet, which accesses the dynamic content from the bean and delivers the content to the client web browser. <br>
