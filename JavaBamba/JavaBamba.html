<h1>IBM Bamba for Java</h1>

<p>
The IBM Bamba for Java applet can be placed in an HTML page using 
the following syntax.  All the attributes (code, codebase...) 
immediately following the opening APPLET tag shown below in the figure 
are needed.  Of the params use of either "src" or "liveport" is 
mandatory and "cabbase" is needed, all others are optional and their 
default values are explained below.

<p>
The following sections now describe in further detail the elements of the syntax

<h2>Applet attribute values</h2>
<p>
These are the attributes of the applet tag interpreted by the browser 
itself. 
<ul>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>
Mandatory
<p>
This refers to the main IBM Bamba for Java player class.  It should not 
be altered.  The same player code can handle either .iba audio clips or 
.iba video/audio clips.  

<h3>Codebase</h3>
<p>
Highly recommended
<p>
This refers to server location in which the IBM Bamba for Java player 
code is installed.  In the above syntax it is assumed that the player is 
installed in the JavaBamba subdirectory - directly off the root 
directory on the server.  When the installation procedure was followed 
the JavaBamba directory tree was created. If you placed the JavaBamba 
inside another directory, e.g. in an applets subdirectory then modify the 
codebase accordingly. The .. is permitted in the codebase e.g. 
../applets/JavaBamba
<p>
The clients browser will re-use the code from the same codebase when 
traversing pages. So after downloading the applet code, from the first 
page encountered, having all the IBM for Java applets refer to the same 
codebase will mean that the downloaded cached code will be used for all 
subsequent pages coded that way. This makes for a much happier client 
whose browser doesn't need to continually re-download the code.
<p>
Note that the codebase can be a fully qualified URL. This is useful for
live streaming as it allows the applet to be served from the same place 
as the live feed but keep the main HTML pages on a centralized web 
server elsewhere.

<h3>Archive</h3>
<p>
Highly recommended
<p>
Some browsers, Netscape Navigator 3.0 and above in particular, can 
download the applet code when stored in a zip.  This means only one HTTP 
Get versus several Gets for the individual classes. The ZIP contains the 
same code and will be used instead of these individual class files for 
those browsers that recognize it.  See also cabbase param for Microsoft 
Internet Explorer.

<h3>Width and height</h3>
<p>
Mandatory
<p>
This is the width and height of the space given to the applet by the 
browser.  For audio only clips width=250 height=50 is a reasonable size 
to choose that is enough space for the controls and status.  The 
slide-bar will shrink/expand to fit the available width - provided it's 
not too small of course.  
<p>
For video clips the space required by the video itself needs to be taken 
into consideration.  The video will be positioned above the controls and 
centered in the area.  It will always be displayed in its original size, 
e.g. a 160x120 clip will need 160x120 for its display.  An additional 5 
pixel border space is needed if a frame is used -see border param.  So 
for 160x120 it needs 170x130 with the border.  Extra space surrounding 
the video is drawn in the background param color.  So as an example, for a 
video whose size is 176x144 (QCIF) a width=250 and height=240 gives 
space for the controls plus a background colored region outside of the 
video frame.  Some experiments with the sizes however will soon lead you 
to the most visually pleasing aspect ratios for your clips.  

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>
Required to identify the applet when you use the endtoPlay parameter and 
want to have this applet started when another finishes.  

<h3>Align, Alt, HSpace, VSpace etc</h3>
<p>
Other attributes of the applet tag may be specified as required. Refer 
to an HTML reference for the meaning of these and any others which are 
supported.
</ul>

<h2>Applet param values</h2>
<p>
These are elements of the applet tag interpreted by the applet code - 
with the exception of the cabbase param for Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<ul>
<h3>src</h3>
<p>
Mandatory for stored clips (see also liveport param below)
<p>
This is the URL for the .iba clip. It is either a full URL e.g. 
http://videos/animals/groundhog.iba or URL relative to the DOCBASE for 
the HTML pages. You may like to keep the clips together or place them in 
the directory with the html page. 

<h3>liveport</h3>
<p>
Mandatory for live streaming (see also src param above)
<p>
This is the port on the server that is providing the live feed. You 
should not use this together with the src param since the player will 
work either as a live streaming player or to play stored clips.
<p>
Please note, unlike the Bamba plug-in, no IP address can be provided for 
the live stream. The live feed MUST be from the same server that 
provides this applet. The Java security model prevents an applet from 
accessing another server unless the applet is signed using a certificate 
- the Bamba For Java applet is not signed and MUST abide by the 
security rules imposed by the browsers and Java VM.
<p>
Note however that the IP address is derived from the codebase and the 
applet (and live feed) can therefore be on a different machine than the 
HTML page is served from (within which the applet tag is authored).

<h3>cabbase</h3>
<p>
Highly recommended
<p>
Like the archive value cabbase refers to a file in which all the 
class files are store. In the case of the CAB (CABinet) file this is 
used by Microsoft Internet Explorer. For further information see the 
Archive tag above.

<h3>autostart</h3>
<p>
Optional - defaults to "false".
<p>
May be set to "false" or "true". This parameter determines whether the 
clip will start playing automatically or wait for the user to press the 
play button. 
<p>
Note: for versions of Bamba For Java prior to 0.98, that did not support 
the endtoPlay param, if showcontrols was set to false then autostart was 
always treated as though it was set true - otherwise the user would have 
had no other way of starting the clip.  Since clips can now start one 
another, using the endtoPlay, autostart is no longer forced true.  

<h3>showcontrols</h3>
<p>
Optional - defaults to "true".
<p>
May be set to "false" or "true". When set "true" (default) controls for 
pause, play, rewind, seek etc are displayed along with status 
information. For video we have allowed the controls to be disabled in 
order that the applet can be placed seamlessly inside other graphics etc 
for specialized visual effects. The clip will start playing 
automatically, see autostart above, if controls are disabled.

<h3>bkcolor</h3> 
<p>
Optional - defaults to <i>light gray.</i>
<p>
Changes the background color for the applet. The value should be a 6 
digit hex code for the colors in the form RRGGBB. By default the color 
is light gray i.e. a value "c0c0c0"

<h3>border</h3>  
<p>
Optional - defaults to "frame".
<p>
For a video clip this allows the author to choose whether or not there 
is any border surrounding the video clip. 
<ul>
<li>
A value of "none" disables 
any border. 
<li>
The value "frame" (default) draws a 5 pixel border around 
the video whose top (north) and left (west) edges are drawn in the 
<b>colornw</b> color and bottom (south) and right (east) edges are drawn 
in the <b>colorse</b> color.  By default these colors give a sunken 
frame effect. By reversing the colors, i.e. lighter on the nw and darker 
on the se a raised button effect is achieved. With both colors the same 
a flat border effect is gained.
<li>
The value "shadow" draws a 5 pixel shadow in the <b>colorse</b> 
color both below and to the right of the video.
</ul>

<h3>colornw</h3> 
<p>
Optional - defaults to <i>dark gray.</i>
<p>
Color for video nw <b>border</b> in RRGGBB form. See border param above.

<h3>colorse</h3> 
<p>
Optional - defaults to <i>white.</i>
<p>
Color for video nw <b>border</b> in RRGGBB form. See border param above.

<h3>endtoURL</h3> 
<p>
Optional
<p>
This optional parameter specifies an HTML page which will be loaded into 
the browser when the clip reaches the end and finishes playing.  
Typically the new page would include another Bamba For Java clip which 
would load the next page and so on.  This permits the creation of say an 
online presentation where each page is automatically flipped to the 
next page when the accompanying audio (or video) clip is complete.
<p>
By making the last page reload the first page it would be possible to 
create a carousel effect where a set of pages are continually played over 
and over in the same sequence.

<h3>endtoTarget</h3> 
<p>
Optional
<p>
To be used in conjunction with endtoURL.  This parameter can be used as 
an option, in addition to endtoURL, to specify the name of the target 
frame or window into which the page should be loaded.  If omitted the 
default browser target is used.  This is identical to specifying a link 
in HTML where a page can be specified (href=) and a target named too; 
for further information on targets consult an HTML reference under the 
&lt;a&gt; tag that is used to create links.

<h3>endtoPlay</h3> 
<p>
Optional
<p>
This optional parameter specifies another Bamba For Java applet (clip) 
that should be started when this applet (clip) reaches the end and 
finishes playing.  The parameter specifies the applet by name and 
requires that the name attribute be used on the APPLET tag e.g.  
name="ClipOne".
<p>
An applet can only be started if it is in the Ready state - this is the 
state that the applet enters after it is loaded before it plays.  Once 
playing has started the applet will never re-enter the Ready state and 
hence this parameter can be used to sequence through the clips on a page 
once only.  Access to be able to start another applet (clip) falls into 
the area of inter-applet communication - which varies by browser - its 
best to keep to applets within the same page and not use frames if you 
want the best chance of working in the most environments.  
<p>
One of the applets on the page would most likely be authored with 
autostart set to true so that it started when the page was loaded and 
became the first applet to play in the sequence and would trigger the 
next to start when it ended.  

</ul>

<li>
Two Bamba clips on a page.  The first clip autostarts and when it 
finishes it starts the second clip.  Note that I have chosen to name 
both applets although arguably only the second applet name is actually 
required.  (If I had chosen to do so I could have used the endtoURL on 
the second clip to load up a new page once that had ended).
