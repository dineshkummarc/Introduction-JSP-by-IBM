We cannot answer each feedback individually but if you see a problem and report it, we will correct it next time we update the course. In your feedback, it helps to identify your hardware and the browser version that you're using.  Also, be sure to mention the name of the course.
<p>
Below, we have captured a number of questions that people have asked about this site. The questions are divided into three categories, <a href="#general">General</a>, <a href="#os2">OS/2</a>, and <a href="#win">Windows</a>. 
<p>

<a name="general"><h3>General</h3></a>


<dl>
<dt><li><u>Bamba Streaming Audio Information</u>
<dd>This course employs Bamba streaming audio technology that runs best under Netscape 4.0, Internet Explorer 4.0 or later versions. The Bamba player is a Java applet. If you don't have a Java-enabled browser or if Java is disabled in your browser, you won't hear audio. Older browsers don't handle the Bamba player effectively. You will experience palette shifts when audio is streaming. Also, older hardware will not have the proper audio card to handle streaming audio.
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><li><u>No Plug-in to Set Up</u>
<dd>To hear audio, just give the Bamba player time to download fully. The download is automatic... you don't have to do anything or find any plug-ins! When the download is finished, you'll hear audio for the discussion item you're on. Once the Bamba player has downloaded, you can use the player controls to stop the audio, then resume it at the beginning or anywhere in the audio file. 
<p>
If your audio is not working properly or if you prefer to read, we've provided all the lecture text in a scrolling box on the right of the screen. It's your choice. Get the information any way it suits you best.

<dt><li><u>More Courses</u>
<dd>Four courses are being developed in this series of "Intro to…" lectures. All the courses use the Dr Java Bean character and run on a 640X480 or higher screen resolution.

<dl>
<dt><li><u>Font Size</u>
<dd>We've noticed that some machines running 800X600 make the text on our
site very difficult to read, especially if your default font is smaller than 12pt. To fix this problem, change your default font to 12pt following the steps below.
<ol>
	<li>Select Options from your browser pulldown menu
	<li>Select General Preferences
	<li>Select the Fonts tab
	<li>Where it says "Use the Proportional Font", select Choose Font
	<li>Select a 12pt default font size
</ol>
</dl>

<dt><li><u>Audio Problems</u>

	<li>  Make sure your audio volume controls are set properly.
	<li>  Make sure you have Multimedia capabilities on your machine.
	<li>  Are you running a Netscape 2.02e browser as a minimum?
